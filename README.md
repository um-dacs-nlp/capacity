## Overview

This project evaluates how decoder-only transformer architectures memorize real-world structured data. We use subsets of the **SNOMED CT** medical knowledge graph to construct two types of datasets:

* **Triplets**: (Concept, Property, Related Concept)
* **Sequences**: Simulated graph walks encoding multi-hop relationships

The experiments assess the influence of:

* Dataset size
* Number of layers
* Activation functions
* Embedding size (total number of parameters)

Using **Maximum Attainable Capacity (MAC)** as a key metric, the study identifies optimal architecture–data trade-offs for memory-limited scenarios (e.g., edge devices).

## 📊 Figures

All plots summarizing experimental results are located in `img/`. The filenames follow the format:

* `1_datasize_*` — Results of Experiment 1 (dataset size)
* `2_layact_*` — Experiment 2 (layer + activation variations)
* `3_paramsize_*` — Experiment 3 (embedding/parameter size)
* `4_seqs_*` — Experiment 4 (sequences)

Each comes in both `.pdf` and `.png` formats.

## 📚 Setup Instructions

**Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⚠️ For the `data_management` part, **Python 3.7** is required due to dependency on `owlready2`.

You will need access to the SNOMED CT ontology file to run the data processing notebooks.

## 🧪 Reproducing Experiments

Each experiment is defined as follows:

1. **Triplets – Dataset Size Impact**
   File: `1_iter_trans_big.ipynb`
   Tests different dataset sizes with a fixed 1-layer transformer.

2. **Triplets – Layer & Activation Influence**
   Files: `2_layers_activations_*`
   Tests ReLU, GELU, RReLU, Softmax with 1/2/4 layers.

3. **Triplets – Parameter Size**
   Files: `3_param_size_*`
   Tests different embedding sizes for fixed parameter budgets.

4. **Sequences – Graph Path Memorization**
   Files: `4_seqs_*`
   Tests ability to memorize sequences with 4–6 nodes.

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

* **Embedding size** is the dominant factor in capacity and speed.
* **Softmax** activation outperforms others in stability and accuracy.
* More layers do **not** improve performance on simple datasets.
* Sequences encode more structure and yield better memorization rates.
* MAC is an efficient alternative to full-scale MLS computation.
